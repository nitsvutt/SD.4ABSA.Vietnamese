# Span Dectection for Aspect-Based Sentiment in Vietnamsese
This is our first project with Natural Language Processing using Deep Learning skills.\
In this project, we read a paper named [Span Dectection for Aspect-Based Sentiment in Vietnamsese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07833) by Kim Thi-Thanh Nguyen and her patner, then we rebuild her model, experiment and compare.\
Although the results were not as expected, we have gained a better understanding of this new problem.
